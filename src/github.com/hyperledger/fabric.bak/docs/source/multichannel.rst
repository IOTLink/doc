Multichannel
============

[WIP]

The fabric will allow for multiple channels with a designated ledger per
channel (data segregation). This capability allows for multilateral
contracts where only the restricted participants on the channel will
submit, endorse, order, or commit transactions on that channel.  As
such, a single peer can maintain multiple ledgers without compromising
privacy and confidentiality.

for more detailed explanation on the mechanics and architecture.
