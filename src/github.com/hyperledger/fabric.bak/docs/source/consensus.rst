Consensus
=========

[WIP]

Not to be conflated with the ordering process. Consensus in v1
architecture is a broader term overarching the entire transactional
flow, which serves to generate an agreement on the order and to confirm
the correctness of the set of transactions constituting a block.

It is achieved as a byproduct of the various steps and verifications
that occur during a transaction's lifecycle from proposal to commitment.
More information on the high-level data flows is available
`here <https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-37>`__.
