Overview
========

This section outlines the key design features woven into Hyperledger Fabric that
fulfill its promise of a comprehensive, yet customizable, enterprise blockchain solution:

* :ref:`Assets` - Asset definitions enable the exchange of almost anything with
  monetary value over the network, from whole foods to antique cars to currency
  futures.
* :ref:`Chaincode` - Chaincode execution is partitioned from transaction ordering,
  limiting the required levels of trust and verification across node types, and
  optimizing network scalability and performance.
* :ref:`Ledger-Features` - The immutable, shared ledger encodes the entire
  transaction history for each channel, and includes SQL-like query capability
  for efficient auditing and dispute resolution.
* :ref:`Privacy-through-Channels` - Channels enable multi-lateral transactions
  with the high degrees of privacy and confidentiality required by competing
  businesses and regulated industries that exchange assets on a common network.
* :ref:`Security-Membership-Services` - Permissioned membership provides a
  trusted blockchain network, where participants know that all transactions can
  be detected and traced by authorized regulators and auditors.
* :ref:`Consensus` - Fabric's unique approach to consensus enables the
  flexibility and scalability needed for the enterprise.
